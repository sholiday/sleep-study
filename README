## Sleep Study

I'm trying to see if there is a connection between sleep and memory/learning.

Over the past term I have been learning/memorizing information for my university
courses using flash cards (Anki). This has been a test for me.

I also have a FitBit One which has been tracking my sleep on most nights.

I wish to gather the data to see if there are any interesting patterns.
